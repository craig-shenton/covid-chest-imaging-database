PHOSP-COVID
-----------

The `Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) <https://www.phosp.org/>`_ is collaborating with the
National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database (NCCID). PHOSP-COVID is a national
consortium, led by experts at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust
under the umbrella of the NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre. It aims
to understand and improve long-term health outcomes for patients who have been
discharged from hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

PHOSP-COVID has been set up and funded as a long term research study to recruit
10,000 patients who have been hospitalised with COVID-19. Over the course of a
year, clinical assessments will track patients to gain a comprehensive picture
of the impact COVID-19 has had on longer term health outcomes across the UK.

PHOSP-COVID will be collecting samples and scans for patients from a network of
Trusts in the UK (see `here <https://www.phosp.org/network/institution-trust/>`__ for the full list).

PHOSP-COVID is collaborating with the NCCID initiative to ensure that the same
sites included in the PHOSP-COVID network are also contributing towards the
NCCID database. This is so that PHOSP-COVID researchers are able to access
via the NCCIDâ€™s data access request process) important data already collected
for patients via the NCCID study in order to accompany the longitudinal data
PHOSP-COVID are collecting for patients.

.. note::
